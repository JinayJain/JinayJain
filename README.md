# Hi, I'm Jinay!

Welcome to my corner of the open source world. I build data-driven applications using machine learning to accelerate the progress of AI. But my interests extend far past AI and into full-stack development, algorithmic problem-solving, and many toy projects for personal enrichment.

**Check out [my website](https://jinay.dev/) to learn more about me!**

I'm also looking for internships in AI and software engineering, feel free to reach out at hi@jinay.dev!
